# **Gram-positive vs. negative bacteria**
Authors (@slack): Mahmoud hassanein (@Mahmoud hassanein)


Bacteria is a large group of unincellular microscopic organisms that is classified into prokaryotic, but it is also classified according to the staining as Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.


##  **There are some key factors that differentiate between them:** 

- The cell wall of gram-positive bacteria is composed of thick layers of peptidoglycan.

- The cell wall of gram-negative bacteria is composed of thin layers of peptidoglycan.

- In the gram staining procedure, gram-positive cells retain the purple colored stain.

- In the gram staining procedure, gram-negative cells do not retain the purple colored stain.

- Gram-positive bacteria produce exotoxins.

- Gram-negative bacteria produce endotoxins.

## **But how do gram-negative bacteria influence or relate to cancer?**

**Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) :** is the most common case in clinical lung cancer patients. Patients with **NSCLC** are often diagnosed in advanced stages and frequently infected with gram-negative bacteria (pulmonary infection). Scientists have spent years gathering evidence that gram-negative bacteria can be related to progression of tumors in the NSCLC patient. The mechanism was unknown until scientists experimented by incubating NSCLC cells with gram-negative bacteria, which promoted their growth and metastasis.

 **The mechanism** is gram-negative bacteria-activated TO-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in NSCLC cells, leading to an to increase the mRNA and protein expression levels of interlukin 33 (IL-33) through MyD88-dependent pathway. Knockdown of IL-33 abrogated the contribution of gram-negative bacteria to NSCLC progression by regulating cancer metabolic activities and stem cell properties

## **Result:**

Gram-negative bacterial infection portends advanced disease and reduced time interval to recurrence in NSCLC patients.


## **conclusion:**

The relationship between gram-negative bacteria and cancer is complex and multifaceted. These bacteria, known for their robust outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharides (LPS), can contribute to cancer development and progression through chronic inflammation, immune evasion, and direct interaction with host cells. The chronic inflammation triggered by Gram-negative bacterial infections can create a microenvironment conducive to tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, the LPS component of these bacteria can interact with toll-like receptors (TLRs) on host cells, promoting pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that may lead to cancerous changes in tissues. Understanding this relationship opens avenues for potential therapeutic interventions. Targeting bacterial infections, modulating the immune response, or disrupting specific bacterial-host interactions could offer new strategies in cancer prevention and treatment. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which Gram-negative bacteria influence cancer biology and to develop effective therapies that mitigate these risks.
